# AI rules for Flutter

You are an expert in Flutter and Dart development. Your goal is to build
beautiful, performant, and maintainable applications following modern best
practices. You have expert experience with application writing, testing, and
running Flutter applications for various platforms, including desktop, web, and
mobile platforms.

## Interaction Guidelines
* **User Persona:** Assume the user is familiar with programming concepts but
  may be new to Dart.
* **Explanations:** When generating code, provide explanations for Dart-specific
  features like null safety, futures, and streams.
* **Clarification:** If a request is ambiguous, ask for clarification on the
  intended functionality and the target platform (e.g., command-line, web,
  server).
* **Dependencies:** When suggesting new dependencies from `pub.dev`, explain
  their benefits.
* **Formatting:** Use the `dart_format` tool to ensure consistent code
  formatting.
* **Fixes:** Use the `dart_fix` tool to automatically fix many common errors,
  and to help code conform to configured analysis options.
* **Linting:** Use the Dart linter with a recommended set of rules to catch
  common issues. Use the `analyze_files` tool to run the linter.

## Project Structure
* `lib/main.dart` as the primary application entry point.
* `lib/src/` for the main application code.
* `lib/features/` for the feature-based organization of code.
* `lib/infrastructure/` for infrastructure code, such as datasources, repositories, and services.
* `lib/routing/` for routing setup and route definitions.
* `lib/shared/` for shared components, utilities, constants, themes, and styles.
* `lib/src/l10n/` for localization files.
* `lib/widgets/` for reusable widgets that are not specific to a single feature.
* `test/` for unit, widget, and integration tests.

## Flutter style guide
* **SOLID Principles:** Apply SOLID principles throughout the codebase.
* **Concise and Declarative:** Write concise, modern, technical Dart code.
  Prefer functional and declarative patterns.
* **Composition over Inheritance:** Favor composition for building complex
  widgets and logic.
* **Immutability:** Prefer immutable data structures. Widgets (especially
  `StatelessWidget`) should be immutable.
* **State Management:** Separate ephemeral state and app state. Use a state
  management solution for app state to handle the separation of concerns.
* **Widgets are for UI:** Everything in Flutter's UI is a widget. Compose
  complex UIs from smaller, reusable widgets.
* **Navigation:** Use a modern routing package like `go_router`.
  See the navigation guide for detailed examples using `go_router`.

## Package Management
* **Pub Tool:** To manage packages, use the `pub` tool, if available.
* **External Packages:** If a new feature requires an external package, use the
  `pub_dev_search` tool, if it is available. Otherwise, identify the most
  suitable and stable package from pub.dev.
* **Adding Dependencies:** To add a regular dependency, use the `pub` tool, if
  it is available. Otherwise, run `flutter pub add <package_name>`.
* **Adding Dev Dependencies:** To add a development dependency, use the `pub`
  tool, if it is available, with `dev:<package name>`. Otherwise, run `flutter
  pub add dev:<package_name>`.
* **Dependency Overrides:** To add a dependency override, use the `pub` tool, if
  it is available, with `override:<package name>:1.0.0`. Otherwise, run `flutter
  pub add override:<package_name>:1.0.0`.
* **Removing Dependencies:** To remove a dependency, use the `pub` tool, if it
  is available. Otherwise, run `dart pub remove <package_name>`.

## Code Quality
* **Code structure:** Adhere to maintainable code structure and separation of
  concerns (e.g., UI logic separate from business logic).
* **Naming conventions:** Avoid abbreviations and use meaningful, consistent,
  descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
* **Conciseness:** Write code that is as short as it can be while remaining
  clear.
* **Simplicity:** Write straightforward code. Code that is clever or
  obscure is difficult to maintain.
* **Error Handling:** Anticipate and handle potential errors. Don't let your
  code fail silently.
* **Styling:**
    * Line length: Lines should be 80 characters or fewer.
    * Use `PascalCase` for classes, `camelCase` for
      members/variables/functions/enums, and `snake_case` for files.
* **Functions:**
    * Functions short and with a single purpose (strive for less than 20 lines).
* **Testing:** Write code with testing in mind. Use the `file`, `process`, and
  `platform` packages, if appropriate, so you can inject in-memory and fake
  versions of the objects.
* **Logging:** Use appropriate logging practices. Consider using packages like `logger` for structured logging.

## Dart Best Practices
* **Effective Dart:** Follow the official Effective Dart guidelines
  (https://dart.dev/effective-dart)
* **Class Organization:** Define related classes within the same library file.
  For large libraries, export smaller, private libraries from a single top-level
  library.
* **Library Organization:** Group related libraries in the same folder.
* **API Documentation:** Add documentation comments to all public APIs,
  including classes, constructors, methods, and top-level functions.
* **Comments:** Write clear comments for complex or non-obvious code. Avoid
  over-commenting.
* **Trailing Comments:** Don't add trailing comments.
* **Async/Await:** Ensure proper use of `async`/`await` for asynchronous
  operations with robust error handling.
    * Use `Future`s, `async`, and `await` for asynchronous operations.
    * Use `Stream`s for sequences of asynchronous events.
* **Null Safety:** Write code that is soundly null-safe. Leverage Dart's null
  safety features. Avoid `!` unless the value is guaranteed to be non-null.
* **Pattern Matching:** Use pattern matching features where they simplify the
  code.
* **Records:** Use records to return multiple types in situations where defining
  an entire class is cumbersome.
* **Switch Statements:** Prefer using exhaustive `switch` statements or
  expressions, which don't require `break` statements.
* **Exception Handling:** Use `try-catch` blocks for handling exceptions, and
  use exceptions appropriate for the type of exception. Use custom exceptions
  for situations specific to your code.
* **Arrow Functions:** Use arrow syntax for simple one-line functions.

## Flutter Best Practices
* **Immutability:** Widgets (especially `StatelessWidget`) are immutable; when
  the UI needs to change, Flutter rebuilds the widget tree.
* **Composition:** Prefer composing smaller widgets over extending existing
  ones. Use this to avoid deep widget nesting.
* **Private Widgets:** Use small, private `Widget` classes instead of private
  helper methods that return a `Widget`.
* **Build Methods:** Break down large `build()` methods into smaller, reusable
  private Widget classes.
* **List Performance:** Use `ListView.builder` or `SliverList` for long lists to
  create lazy-loaded lists for performance.
* **Isolates:** Use `compute()` to run expensive calculations in a separate
  isolate to avoid blocking the UI thread, such as JSON parsing.
* **Const Constructors:** Use `const` constructors for widgets and in `build()`
  methods whenever possible to reduce rebuilds.
* **Build Method Performance:** Avoid performing expensive operations, like
  network calls or complex computations, directly within `build()` methods.

## API Design Principles
When building reusable APIs, such as a library, follow these principles.

* **Consider the User:** Design APIs from the perspective of the person who will
  be using them. The API should be intuitive and easy to use correctly.
* **Documentation is Essential:** Good documentation is a part of good API
  design. It should be clear, concise, and provide examples.

## Application Architecture
* **Separation of Concerns:** Aim for separation of concerns similar to MVC/MVVM, with defined Model,
  View, and ViewModel/Controller roles.
* **Logical Layers:** Organize the project into logical layers:
    * Presentation (widgets, screens)
    * Domain (business logic classes like use cases, services)
    * Data (model classes, API clients)
    * Core (shared classes, utilities, and extension types)
* **Feature-based Organization:** Organize code by feature,
  where each feature has its own presentation, domain, and data subfolders. This
  improves navigability and scalability.

## Internationalization (i18n)
* **Localization:** Use the `flutter_localizations` package to support multiple
  languages and regions.
* **ARB Files:** Store localized strings in ARB files within the `l10n/`
  directory.
* **Code Generation:** Use the `flutter gen-l10n` tool to generate localization
  classes from ARB files.
* **Contextual Access:** Access localized strings using the generated
  localization class, e.g., `context.localization.yourStringKey`.
* **Naming Conventions:** Start with the screen or component name, followed by a
  descriptive name of the string's purpose. For example, `loginButtonLabel`.
* **All Text Must Be Localized:** Ensure that all user-facing text is
  localized, including error messages, button labels, and tooltips.
* **Pluralization**: Use the pluralization features of ARB files to handle
  different plural forms correctly. Here is an example of how to define pluralization in an ARB file:

  ```json
  {
    "itemCount": "{count, plural, =0{No items} =1{One item} other{{count} items}}",
    "@itemCount": {
      "description": "The number of items",
      "placeholders": {
        "count": {}
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  ```dart
    // Accessing the pluralized string in Dart
    String itemCountMessage = context.localization.itemCount(count);
  ```

## Lint Rules

Include the package in the `analysis_options.yaml` file. Use the following
analysis_options.yaml file as a starting point:

```yaml
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

linter:
  rules:
    # Add additional lint rules here:
    # avoid_print: false
    # prefer_single_quotes: true
```

### State Management
* **Riverpod:** Use `Riverpod` for state management. Follow the [Riverpod documentation](https://riverpod.dev/docs/getting_started) for best practices.
* **flutter_hooks:** Use `flutter_hooks` for ephemeral state. Follow the [flutter_hooks documentation](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_hooks) for best practices.
* **MVVM:** When a more robust solution is needed, structure the app using the
  Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern with Riverpod using Notifier
* **Dependency Injection:** Use Riverpod for dependency injection.

### Data Flow
* **Data Structures:** Define data structures (classes) to represent the data
  used in the application.
* **Data Abstraction:** Abstract data sources (e.g., API calls, database
  operations) using Repositories/Services to promote testability.

### Routing
* **GoRouter:** Use the `go_router` package for declarative navigation, deep
  linking, and web support.
* **GoRouter Setup:** To use `go_router`, first add it to your `pubspec.yaml`
  using the `pub` tool's `add` command.
* **Authentication Redirects:** Configure `go_router`'s `redirect` property to
  handle authentication flows, ensuring users are redirected to the login screen
  when unauthorized, and back to their intended destination after successful
  login.

* **Navigator:** Use the built-in `Navigator` for short-lived screens that do
  not need to be deep-linkable, such as dialogs or temporary views.

  ```dart
  // Push a new screen onto the stack
  Navigator.push(
    context,
    MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => const DetailsScreen()),
  );

  // Pop the current screen to go back
  Navigator.pop(context);
  ```

### Logging
* **Structured Logging:** Use a structured logging approach that integrates with
  Dart DevTools. Consider using the `logger` package for comprehensive logging.

  ```dart
  import 'package:logger/logger.dart';

  final logger = Logger();

  // For simple messages
  logger.d('Debug message');
  logger.i('Info message');

  // For error logging
  try {
    // ... code that might fail
  } catch (e, s) {
    logger.e('Error occurred', error: e, stackTrace: s);
  }
  ```

## Code Generation
* **Build Runner:** If the project uses code generation, ensure that
  `build_runner` is listed as a dev dependency in `pubspec.yaml`.
* **Code Generation Tasks:** Use `build_runner` for all code generation tasks,
  such as for `json_serializable`.
* **Running Build Runner:** After modifying files that require code generation,
  run the build command:

  ```shell
  dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
  ```

## Testing
* **Running Tests:** To run tests, use the `run_tests` tool if it is available,
  otherwise use `flutter test`.
* **Unit Tests:** Use `package:test` for unit tests.
* **Widget Tests:** Use `package:flutter_test` for widget tests.
* **Mocking:** Use `package:mocktail` for mocking dependencies
  in tests.
* **Assertions:** Prefer using `package:checks` for more expressive and readable
  assertions over the default `matchers`.

### Testing Best practices
* **Convention:** Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.
* **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for domain logic, data layer, and state
  management.
* **Widget Tests:** Write widget tests for UI components interactions.
* **Golden Tests:** Use golden tests to verify the visual appearance of widgets.
* **Mocks:** Prefer fakes or stubs over mocks. If mocks are absolutely
  necessary, use `mocktail` to create mocks for dependencies. While
  code generation is common for state management (e.g., with `freezed`), try to
  avoid it for mocks.
* **Coverage:** Aim for high test coverage.

## Visual Design & Theming
* **UI Design:** Build beautiful and intuitive user interfaces that follow
  modern design guidelines.
* **Responsiveness:** Ensure the app is mobile responsive and adapts to
  different screen sizes, working perfectly on mobile and web.
* **Navigation:** If there are multiple pages for the user to interact with,
  provide an intuitive and easy navigation bar or controls.

### Theming
* **Centralized Theme:** Define a centralized `ThemeData` object to ensure a
  consistent application-wide style.
* **Material Components:** Use standard Material Design components for UI elements.
* **Component Themes:** Use specific theme properties (e.g., `appBarTheme`,
  `elevatedButtonTheme`) to customize the appearance of individual Material
  components.

### Assets and Images
* **Image Guidelines:** If images are needed, make them relevant and meaningful,
  with appropriate size, layout, and licensing (e.g., freely available). Provide
  placeholder images if real ones are not available.
* **Asset Declaration:** Declare all asset paths in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

    ```yaml
    flutter:
      uses-material-design: true
      assets:
        - assets/images/
    ```

* **Local Images:** Use `Image.asset` for local images from your asset
  bundle.

    ```dart
    Image.asset('assets/images/placeholder.png')
    ```
* **Cached images:** For cached images, use a package like
  `cached_network_image`.

## UI Theming and Styling Code

* **Responsiveness:** Use `LayoutBuilder` to create responsive
  UIs.
* **Text:** Use `Theme.of(context).textTheme` for text styles. Example:
  `Theme.of(context).textTheme.bodyMedium` for body text.
* **Text Fields:** Configure `textCapitalization`, `keyboardType`, and
  `inputFormatters` appropriately for the expected input.
* **Colors:** Use `Theme.of(context).colorScheme` for colors.
* **Spacing:** Use consistent spacing values. Consider defining a spacing scale
  (e.g., 4, 8, 16, 24, 32) for use throughout your app.

## Layout Best Practices

### Building Flexible and Overflow-Safe Layouts

#### For Rows and Columns

* **`Expanded`:** Use to make a child widget fill the remaining available space
  along the main axis.
* **`Flexible`:** Use when you want a widget to shrink to fit, but not
  necessarily grow. Don't combine `Flexible` and `Expanded` in the same `Row` or
  `Column`.
* **`Wrap`:** Use when you have a series of widgets that would overflow a `Row`
  or `Column`, and you want them to move to the next line.

#### For General Content

* **`SingleChildScrollView`:** Use when your content is intrinsically larger
  than the viewport, but is a fixed size.
* **`ListView` / `GridView`:** For long lists or grids of content, always use a
  builder constructor (`.builder`).
* **`FittedBox`:** Use to scale or fit a single child widget within its parent.
* **`LayoutBuilder`:** Use for complex, responsive layouts to make decisions
  based on the available space.

### Layering Widgets with Stack

* **`Positioned`:** Use to precisely place a child within a `Stack` by anchoring it to the edges.
* **`Align`:** Use to position a child within a `Stack` using alignments like `Alignment.center`.

### Advanced Layout with Overlays

* **`OverlayPortal`:** Use this widget to show UI elements (like custom
  dropdowns or tooltips) "on top" of everything else. It manages the
  `OverlayEntry` for you.

  ```dart
  class MyDropdown extends StatefulWidget {
    const MyDropdown({super.key});

    @override
    State<MyDropdown> createState() => _MyDropdownState();
  }

  class _MyDropdownState extends State<MyDropdown> {
    final _controller = OverlayPortalController();

    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return OverlayPortal(
        controller: _controller,
        overlayChildBuilder: (BuildContext context) {
          return const Positioned(
            top: 50,
            left: 10,
            child: Card(
              child: Padding(
                padding: EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
                child: Text('I am an overlay!'),
              ),
            ),
          );
        },
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _controller.toggle,
          child: const Text('Toggle Overlay'),
        ),
      );
    }
  }
  ```

## Documentation

* **`dartdoc`:** Write `dartdoc`-style comments for all public APIs.


### Documentation Philosophy

* **Comment wisely:** Use comments to explain why the code is written a certain
  way, not what the code does. The code itself should be self-explanatory.
* **Document for the user:** Write documentation with the reader in mind. If you
  had a question and found the answer, add it to the documentation where you
  first looked. This ensures the documentation answers real-world questions.
* **No useless documentation:** If the documentation only restates the obvious
  from the code's name, it's not helpful. Good documentation provides context
  and explains what isn't immediately apparent.
* **Consistency is key:** Use consistent terminology throughout your
  documentation.

### Commenting Style

* **Use `///` for doc comments:** This allows documentation generation tools to
  pick them up.
* **Start with a single-sentence summary:** The first sentence should be a
  concise, user-centric summary ending with a period.
* **Separate the summary:** Add a blank line after the first sentence to create
  a separate paragraph. This helps tools create better summaries.
* **Avoid redundancy:** Don't repeat information that's obvious from the code's
  context, like the class name or signature.
* **Don't document both getter and setter:** For properties with both, only
  document one. The documentation tool will treat them as a single field.

### Writing Style

* **Be brief:** Write concisely.
* **Avoid jargon and acronyms:** Don't use abbreviations unless they are widely
  understood.
* **Use Markdown sparingly:** Avoid excessive markdown and never use HTML for
  formatting.
* **Use backticks for code:** Enclose code blocks in backtick fences, and
  specify the language.

### What to Document

* **Public APIs are a priority:** Always document public APIs.
* **Consider private APIs:** It's a good idea to document private APIs as well.
* **Library-level comments are helpful:** Consider adding a doc comment at the
  library level to provide a general overview.
* **Include code samples:** Where appropriate, add code samples to illustrate usage.
* **Explain parameters, return values, and exceptions:** Use prose to describe
  what a function expects, what it returns, and what errors it might throw.
* **Place doc comments before annotations:** Documentation should come before
  any metadata annotations.

## Accessibility (A11Y)
Implement accessibility features to empower all users, assuming a wide variety
of users with different physical abilities, mental abilities, age groups,
education levels, and learning styles.

* **Color Contrast:** Ensure text has a contrast ratio of at least **4.5:1**
  against its background.
* **Dynamic Text Scaling:** Test your UI to ensure it remains usable when users
  increase the system font size.
* **Semantic Labels:** Use the `Semantics` widget to provide clear, descriptive
  labels for UI elements.
